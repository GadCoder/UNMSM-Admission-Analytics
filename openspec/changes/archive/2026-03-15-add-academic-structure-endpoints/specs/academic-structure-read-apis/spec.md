## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Academic structure read endpoints
The system SHALL expose read-only endpoints for academic areas, faculties, and majors at `GET /areas`, `GET /areas/{area_id}`, `GET /faculties`, `GET /faculties/{faculty_id}`, `GET /majors`, and `GET /majors/{major_id}`.

#### Scenario: List endpoints return full datasets
- **WHEN** a client requests `GET /areas`, `GET /faculties`, or `GET /majors`
- **THEN** the API returns the full dataset for the requested entity type without pagination

#### Scenario: Detail endpoints return single resources
- **WHEN** a client requests `GET /areas/{area_id}`, `GET /faculties/{faculty_id}`, or `GET /majors/{major_id}` with an existing ID
- **THEN** the API returns the corresponding single resource representation

### Requirement: Missing resource behavior for detail endpoints
The system MUST return HTTP 404 for area, faculty, or major detail requests when the requested resource does not exist.

#### Scenario: Area detail not found
- **WHEN** `GET /areas/{area_id}` is called with a non-existent ID
- **THEN** the API responds with HTTP 404

#### Scenario: Faculty detail not found
- **WHEN** `GET /faculties/{faculty_id}` is called with a non-existent ID
- **THEN** the API responds with HTTP 404

#### Scenario: Major detail not found
- **WHEN** `GET /majors/{major_id}` is called with a non-existent ID
- **THEN** the API responds with HTTP 404

### Requirement: Explicit response schema contracts
The system SHALL return responses through explicit Pydantic response schemas for list and detail endpoints.

#### Scenario: Area response shape is explicit
- **WHEN** areas are returned from list or detail endpoints
- **THEN** each response item includes `id`, `name`, and `slug`

#### Scenario: Faculty response shape is explicit
- **WHEN** faculties are returned from list or detail endpoints
- **THEN** each response item includes `id`, `name`, `slug`, `academic_area_id`, and `academic_area_name`
